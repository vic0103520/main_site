===== Abstract =====

FinTech/Blockchain is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it,
nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is
doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it. In this talk, we are
going to review the history of FinTech and blockchain and introduce
how it works in the modern computing environment. The talk covers how
Bitcoin (digital currency) and Etherereum (smart contract) which are
the two of the most important blockchain-based applications are
designed and implemented; and what are the pros and cons of such
blockchain-based applications. Digital currency allows for
instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer-of-ownership. Smart
contracts are computer protocols intended to facilitate, verify, or
enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. They both seem
quite nice and convenient for us in the digital world, but we should
pay attention that Bitcoin and Etherereum have certain limitations
that we might neglect before and should point out. Further, not all
the FinTech problems can be solved by the blockchain; if we understand
the limitation of such new technologies, we could find a better way to
utilize them.
